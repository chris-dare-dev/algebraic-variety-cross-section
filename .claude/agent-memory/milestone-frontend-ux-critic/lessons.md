## COMPACTED ARCHIVE (panel-refresh-2026q2-e2 through qtawesome-icons-2026q2-e1)

### Token-discipline recurring patterns
- **Dual-branch inline literal:** Always verify EVERY call site of a color literal in a file, not just the one the diff author patched. `app.py:_apply_domain_and_render` has two paths; only one was migrated in UPL-1.
- **setStyleSheet-only dark mode QPalette gap:** For any new dark-mode QSS block, verify BOTH `background:` AND `color:` are explicit — missing either half causes the widget to inherit the wrong half from the platform palette. Canonical example: `QDockWidget::title` sets `background:` but not `color:`.
- **Dead import from refactor:** When an accessor function replaces direct dict references, the direct symbol often lingers in the import. Grep for the replaced symbol at the end of every refactor pass.
- **AI-13 fast gate:** Ask "does this color arg reach `pv.Plotter.add_mesh`?" before applying AI-13. `qta.icon(color=...)` goes to QPainter, NOT PyVista. Float shading params (`ambient=0.15`) are not color arguments.
- **Icon color vs button-text color mismatch:** If a button has a custom QSS `color:` token, the icon factory should use that same token, not the default `TEXT_VALUE`.

### Contrast ratio discipline
- Do not trust inherited contrast annotations — re-measure. Found inaccurate comments in panel-refresh-2026q2-e2 (5.4:1 actual 6.05:1) and variety-palette-2026q2-e1 (hue-separation claimed 25° actual 24.69°).
- Dual-surface contrast check: verify BOTH BG_VIEWPORT (dark, for mesh) AND BG_PANEL (light, for swatches). Mid-lightness pastels for dark-viewport always fail light-panel.
- `FOCUS_RING` passed dark but failed light; `#3c82c4` = 3.56:1 vs `#f0f0f0` is a narrow-pass band matching macOS/GNOME peer norms. Add "(narrow margin; do not lighten further)" when ratio < 3.6:1 on 3:1 floor.

### Industry-comparison concrete recommendations (archived)
- ParaView CSS-variable-style tokens → correct architectural call for PALETTE_LIGHT/DARK pattern.
- ParaView 5.12 lighting: `ambient=0.1, diffuse=0.8` validates UPL-9's `0.15/0.85`.
- ParaView dark-chip swatch → the fix when a swatch color is meant for a dark viewport (show swatch on dark chip).
- "View > Theme submenu" is the correct IA for theme selection (ParaView/Blender bury theme under preferences, not top-level menu).
- ParaView separate-glyph icons for ±axis directions (NOT `rotated=180` copies): upside-down embedded letters at 16px.
- Blender 4.x: checkable QPushButton for display toggles, NOT QCheckBox.setIcon() (three-element prefix is ambiguous).
- Blender 4.x: left-aligns ALL icon+text controls uniformly within a panel. text-align: left on only some buttons creates alignment fracture.
- Blender 4.x destructive buttons: icon colored in same hue family as button text. Mathematica `Manipulate[]` reset: double-arrow glyph, not single-arrow.

### First-launch / section-9 regressions (recurring pattern)
- Fast check: trace `set_default_color` / `refresh_icons` / any new method → does it call `_render_current` or touch `variety_combo`/`subtype_combo`? If not, section-9.3 is clean.
- `_on_variety_changed` and `_on_subtype_changed` are separate handlers; `set_default_color` in `_on_variety_changed` is NOT on the render path.
- Actor color not pushed on theme switch (MEDIUM-3 pattern): `_on_theme_changed` → `set_default_color` but NOT `apply_to_actor`. Flag whenever a milestone diverges variety colors by theme.

### Scope discipline
- Files without a Qt widget class (test files, scripts, references) are not critique-surface even if they're in the diff. Dispose per-axis as "not applicable."

## enriques-backface-2026q2-e1 — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand-enum, no processEvents. Fast dispose: if diff adds no QColor, no Qt.AlignmentFlag, no processEvents, no pv.add_mesh() — dispose AI-9/AI-11/AI-12/AI-13 in one sentence.

### Industry-comparison note
- **ParaView 5.13 backface culling is an explicit opt-in checkbox** (defaults OFF). AVC's hardcoded-on-for-Enriques is bespoke. Concrete recommendation: always expose variety-level rendering state as user-visible status even when hardcoded. Quote "ParaView opt-in checkbox vs AVC silent-on" for any future hidden rendering knob.
- **Mathematica `ContourPlot3D` mesh overlay is always two-sided.** Culling should be suppressed when wireframe is active. Quote as "Mathematica mesh-overlay convention."

### Wireframe + culling recurring pattern
- VTK culling applies at face level regardless of `style="wireframe"`. For any future milestone adding per-variety culling, ALWAYS check if `apply_to_actor` suppresses culling when wireframe is active. Fix: `effective_culling = "none" if self._wireframe else (self._culling or "none")`.

### Topology-claim precision
- When a variety-level gate claims "all N figures share topology X", verify per-figure. Cayley quartic symmetroid has ODP singularities, not the double-curve topology claimed in UPL-7 comment. Gate is safe but justification is imprecise — flag as LOW.

---

## status-bar-bbox-2026q2-e1 (UPL-13 status-bar spatial bbox) — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand-enum, no processEvents in a f-string suffix diff. `_b[1]/.2f` is a float format specifier, not a hex color — AI-13 does not apply to numeric format strings.

### Industry-comparison note
- **ParaView, MeshLab, Blender all use full-extent widths (diameter), not half-extents.** AVC's `±max` half-extent convention was unique in the peer landscape. Quote "full-extent peer-alignment" recommendation for any future bbox-display milestone.

### Status-bar overflow recurring risk
- Whenever a suffix is appended to `base_msg`, check the warning path `f"⚠ {_surface_warning}  |  {base_msg}"` too. The Dwork warning text is ~175 chars; any suffix pushes the combined message past the ~120-char visible window. MEDIUM (supplementary info, not safety-critical).

---

## focus-ring-contrast-2026q2-e1 (FOCUS_RING accessibility) — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- Single shared value with different per-theme headrooms: OLD dark=5.17:1 regressed to 3.78:1 after darkening to fix light. Report delta for BOTH themes, not just "both PASS."

### Industry-comparison note
- macOS Sequoia (#007aff) = 3.53:1; GNOME Adwaita (#3584e4) = 3.31:1. Both in same narrow-pass band as #3c82c4 (3.56:1). Quote as "peer-calibrated narrow-pass" when challenged. Windows 11 (#005499) is deeper (5.6–6.8:1) if more headroom is desired.

### Negative test as machine-readable design intent
- The docstring-only deterrent ("do NOT widen this assertion set") is a recurring pattern risk. Whenever a test has a "don't add X" docstring caveat, the stronger fix is a complementary NEGATIVE test (assert < threshold) that makes the intent machine-readable. Flag any "do not include" docstring caveat on a test as LOW and suggest a companion negative-assertion test.
- "Do not widen this assertion set" docstring caveat → suggest companion NEGATIVE assertion test. Flag any "do not include" docstring caveat on a test as LOW.

## realtime-variety-render-e4 (CAND-4 background-thread mesh worker) — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand-enum, no color token in this diff at all. The two new Qt enums (`Qt.ConnectionType.QueuedConnection`, `Qt.CursorShape.WaitCursor`) were already fully qualified. Fast check held: a threading-only diff adds no QColor / no Qt.AlignmentFlag — dispose AI-12/AI-13 in one sentence, only check AI-11 on the new connection/cursor enums.

### The "early return before the try/finally" trap — a recurring pattern to flag fast
- When a slot acquires a resource (override cursor, a `_computing`/in-flight flag) at *dispatch* time and releases it in a `finally` at *result* time, any `return` placed ABOVE the `try:` skips the release. In e4, `_on_mesh_ready`'s `is_stale_result` guard is a bare `return` before the `try` — on the stale path the wait cursor leaks (setOverrideCursor stack never popped) and `_computing` stays True forever → permanent soft-freeze. It is dead code TODAY under the single-flight guard, but the worker module's own docstring anticipates the guard being lifted. Flag this as MEDIUM (latent hard-failure, not reachable yet). Fast check for any async-slot milestone: trace every `return` in the result slot and confirm it is INSIDE the `try` whose `finally` does the cleanup.

### Status-bar feedback under re-entrancy — the "label binding" axis
- A `Computing {surface.label}…` message set at *dispatch* time is bound to the DISPATCHED surface, not the user's current selection. If the user switches surface while a worker is in flight (subtype combo → `_render_current` hits the `_computing` busy branch and returns without touching the status bar), the status bar advertises the OLD surface name for the full remaining flight. Flag as MEDIUM. The fix is to refresh the status bar to `_current_surface.label` in the busy early-return branch. 3D Slicer's per-job status widget (bound to the job, never lagging the selection) is the peer model — quote it.
- Empty-message exceptions (`MemoryError`, arg-less `KeyError`) make `f"Error: {str(exc)}"` render as a content-free `Error: `. Pre-existing pattern carried over from the synchronous code, but a worker-result refactor is the natural fix point — capture `type(exc).__name__` into the result payload and fall back to it. Flag MEDIUM whenever a status-bar error path interpolates a bare `str(exc)`.

### Industry-comparison note (concrete recommendations generated)
- **ParaView**: long compute → determinate status-bar progress bar (`pqProgressManager`) + Abort button, not just a busy cursor. AVC e4 ships the non-blocking half; progress + cancellation are the v1 follow-ons. Note: `QThreadPool` does NOT cancel a running `QRunnable` — cancellation needs a cooperative flag checked inside `surface.generate()`. Quote "ParaView status-bar progress + Abort" when text-only `Computing…` feedback is questioned.
- **3D Slicer**: CLI logic state machine (Idle→Scheduled→Running→Completed) in a per-module status widget, bound to the job not the UI selection — the model for fixing lagging-label bugs.
- **VisIt** (separate MPI compute engine) and **Mathematica `Manipulate`** (async re-eval + "computing" shimmer) are the other two valid peers for the "compute off the UI thread" axis.

### Scope discipline
- `render_worker.py` is NEW but is NOT a Qt-panel critique surface: it defines `QRunnable`/`QObject` carrier classes + a dataclass + a pure free function — no `QWidget`, no panel, no user-visible chrome. Dispose it (and `tests/test_render_worker.py`) as out-of-panel-scope. Keep this fast: a file with QObject/QRunnable but zero QWidget subclass is worker/plumbing, not panel surface.
- A pure threading refactor legitimately produces an all-MEDIUM-or-below critique. Axes 1-4,6-9,11 each dispose in one line. Do not manufacture findings to fill CRITICAL/HIGH — 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 3 MEDIUM is the honest calibration here.

## qtawesome-icons-2026q2-e2 + display-toggles-checkable-button-2026q3-e1 — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- `QSize(16, 16)` is a plain constructor, not a Qt enum — AI-11 does not apply. Ask "is this a Qt.* / QSizePolicy.* enum call or a plain constructor?"
- `BG_TOGGLE_CHECKED` flows only into QSS, NOT PyVista — AI-13 clear. Checked-state WCAG: fill needs text-on-fill contrast (9.89:1 / 10.20:1), NOT fill-vs-ground if border carries the non-text obligation.

### Industry-comparison concrete findings
- **Ghost-button unchecked state:** Blender 4.x / 3D Slicer / ParaView all give off-state toggles visible chrome. Transparent-unchecked is a Material Design web convention, not desktop sci-viz. Flag any transparent-unchecked display toggle as MEDIUM.
- **Border-width jitter:** Changing `border-width` from 1px to 2px in checked QSS causes 1px content shift. Fix: compensate padding by -1px or use `outline:` which renders outside box model. Always LOW on any QPushButton changing border-width between pseudo-states.
- **Pattern-A architecture for refresh_icons:** verify all 3 call sites are symmetric (`__init__`, `_on_theme_changed`, `_apply_system_theme`). Missing one = icons don't update on theme swap.

## status-bar-bbox-2026q2-e2 (UPL-13 full-extent e2) — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand-enum, no processEvents, no pv.add_mesh() — text-only f-string change. All four AI-9/AI-11/AI-12/AI-13 axes disposed in one sentence.
- Float format specifiers (`.3f`) are not hex colors. AI-13 gate: "does this arg reach PyVista?" — if not, clear.

### Label-precision regression (MEDIUM-1 this milestone)
- **e1 "bbox ±..." → e2 "size: ..."** is a data improvement (full-extent vs half-extent) but a label-precision regression. The word "bbox" explicitly named the measurement type; bare "size:" does not. MeshLab always uses "Bounding Box" as qualifier; ParaView uses "Bounds"; Blender uses "Dimensions". None use bare "size:" without a type qualifier.
- Character cost of `"bbox:"` vs `"size:"` is ZERO (both 5 chars with colon). The compactness trade-off that might justify dropping the qualifier does not hold here.
- Fast flag: whenever a milestone renames a status-bar token, check whether the new name preserves the MEASUREMENT TYPE signal. Renaming from a qualified label (bbox, bounds) to an unqualified label (size, dims) is always a regression risk.

### Industry-comparison notes
- **MeshLab "Bounding Box Size":** `dim_x()` / `dim_y()` / `dim_z()` API always qualifies with "Bounding Box." Full-extent formula is `max - min` per axis — identical to e2's `_b[1]-_b[0]`.
- **ParaView "Bounds":** shows `X Range: [min, max]` — uses "Bounds" not "size." Supports using `bbox:` over `size:`.
- **`.3f` trailing zeros for symmetric generators** (6.400, 3.000): trailing zeros are exact (sampling domain is exactly that wide), not over-precise. The `.3f` rationale (avoid false equalities at sub-1.0: 0.530 ≠ 0.540) is sound; `:.4g` is an optional cosmetic alternative.

### First-launch / section-9 regressions
- No regression possible from a text-only status-bar label change. `size_suffix` is only emitted in the success branch of `_render_current`, unreachable from `-- Select --`.

## enriques-hq-smoothing-2026q3-e1 — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand-enum, no processEvents outside the existing guard. Fast dispose in one sentence: no QColor literals added, no Qt.Align* usages, `Signal(bool)` from PySide6.QtCore correctly qualified.
- `extra_kwargs: dict = {}` / `extra_kwargs["hq_smoothing"] = True` — not a color literal; AI-13 gate: "does this reach PyVista color=?" No — it is a bool kwarg to the generator. Clear.

### Industry-comparison concrete findings
- **Qt macOS disabled-widget tooltip gap:** `QApplication.setAttribute(Qt.ApplicationAttribute.AA_EnableToolTipsOnDisabledWidgets, True)` in `main()` is the one-line fix for "tooltip invisible on greyed button on macOS." Quote this whenever a button is `setEnabled(False)` with a populated `setToolTip()` — the combination silently breaks on macOS without the attribute set.
- **ParaView OSPRay "OSPRay rendering..." status label** is the canonical model for attributing render-time overhead to an active quality toggle in the status bar. Whenever a milestone adds a user-toggled quality mode that changes generation time, flag the absence of a mode indicator in the computing/success status message as MEDIUM.
- **Blender 4.x icon uniformity in a group:** all controls in the same group carry the same icon-size footprint — icon on ALL or NONE. A plain-text button between two icon+text buttons in the same QGroupBox is flagged as alignment fracture. Fast check: scan `_build_toggles_group`-equivalent methods for `setIcon` / `refresh_icons` coverage vs button count.

### Performance-disclosure precision pattern
- **Relative overhead (%) is hardware-independent; absolute (ms) is hardware-specific.** Always flag absolute-ms performance claims in tooltips as HIGH if the measurement is dev-machine-only. The fix: cite both "+N% / hardware-dependent" (relative, universally true) AND "(measured ~Xms on a reference machine at Y resolution)" (absolute, with explicit caveat). This pattern recurs whenever a milestone introduces an opt-in quality mode backed by a spike measurement from a single test machine.

### First-launch / section-9 regressions
- No regression: `set_hq_smoothing_eligible` does not call `_render_current` or touch `variety_combo`. `_on_hq_smoothing_changed` is a no-op when `_raw_mesh is None`. Fast verify: trace the new public methods — if none touch `_render_current` or the combo boxes, section-9.3 is clean.

### State-reset-on-navigate UX
- Unconditional `setChecked(False)` on `set_hq_smoothing_eligible(False)` is the "clear" pattern. This is defensible (avoids dangling-enabled bugs) but is the minority peer pattern (ParaView / SageMath both preserve per-object state). Flag as LOW when the state-clear has no status-bar feedback — the user cannot observe the reset happened.

## appearance-panel-layout-pass-2026q3-e2 — 2026-05-22

### Token-discipline near-misses
- No short-hex, no shorthand enum, no processEvents, no pv.add_mesh() color args. Fast dispose in one sentence: diff adds zero QColor literals, zero Qt.Align* shorthands, zero processEvents calls — AI-9/AI-11/AI-12/AI-13 all clear.
- **`background:` missing from QSS role rule** is NOT an AI-13 issue (no PyVista) but IS a platform-bypass bug: on macOS Aqua (no `setStyle("Fusion")` in `main()`), `text-align` is silently ignored unless `background:` forces full QSS paint mode. The companion `display-toggle` rule correctly includes `background: transparent` for exactly this reason. Fast check for any future QSS `text-align` rule on QPushButton: confirm `background:` is also present, or confirm `setStyle("Fusion")` is called at app start.

### Industry-comparison surprises
- **MeshLab "Render Mode"** applies exclusively to display-pipeline controls (Wireframe/Solid/Points) — NO generation-time quality toggles. The F-L2 recommendation to use "Render Mode" was made before HQ smoothing was added to the group. When a group gains a member that is categorically different from its label (mesh regeneration vs actor display), the label needs a follow-on revision. Quote: "MeshLab Render Mode = display-pipeline only; HQ smoothing is a regeneration toggle — the label broke when the group gained a new category member."
- **ParaView 5.13** separates "Representation" (display) from "Advanced" (quality/generation controls) in collapsed sections. This is the concrete peer model for splitting AVC's mixed-category "Render Mode" group into "Display" + "Quality". Quote when MEDIUM-2 is acted on.

### First-launch / section-9 regressions
- Clean: `_build_toggles_group` and `_build_color_group` are called from `_build_ui` → `__init__` only; no path to `_render_current` or combo boxes. Section-9.3 fast check: look for `_render_current`, `variety_combo`, `subtype_combo` in the new method — none found.

### Group-label precision pattern (new recurring check)
- When a QGroupBox label is renamed, ask: "Does the new label accurately describe ALL members of the group?" A label correct for 2/3 members that silently misclassifies the third is a LOW-MEDIUM finding (MEDIUM-2 here). Fast check: enumerate the group's children, classify each as "label-category-compliant" or "outlier." One outlier at a functionally different latency class = MEDIUM.

### QSS `text-align` on macOS native QPushButton — canonical fix
- `text-align: left` is silently ignored on macOS Aqua unless at least one of `background:`, `color:` (non-inherited), or `image:` is also set (forces QSS paint mode). `padding` and `border-radius` alone do NOT force paint mode on Aqua. The `display-toggle` rule's `background: transparent` is the proof that this was known — but `colors-button` was added without it. For any future `QPushButton` QSS rule that relies on `text-align`, confirm `background:` is present.
